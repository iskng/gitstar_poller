# Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### Server (Rust) Updates
1. **Fixed relationship creation** in `insert_stargazers_batch`:
   - Now creates `github_user -> starred -> repo` relationships
   - Sets source as 'stargazer_analysis' to distinguish from user's own stars
   - Properly handles duplicate relationships

2. **Database operations** now use RecordIds throughout:
   - No more string manipulation of IDs
   - Proper RecordId types passed between functions
   - Clean separation of concerns

3. **GitHub user handling**:
   - Creates/updates github_user records with proper fields
   - Uses username as the ID (e.g., `github_user:octocat`)

### Frontend (Next.js) Updates (Already Done)
1. **GitHub user creation**:
   - Fetches GitHub user info via API
   - Creates/updates github_user record
   - Links to platform user via `githubUser` field

2. **Starred relationships**:
   - Creates `github_user -> starred -> repo` relationships
   - Sets source as 'github' for user's own stars
   - Handles cleanup of removed stars

## Database Structure

### Tables
- `user` - Platform users (has `githubUser` field linking to github_user)
- `github_user` - GitHub user accounts
- `repo` - GitHub repositories
- `starred` - Relationship: `github_user -> starred -> repo`
- `repo_processing_status` - Tracks stargazer analysis progress

### Relationship Sources
- `'github'` - User's own starred repos (set by frontend)
- `'stargazer_analysis'` - Discovered by analyzing repo stargazers (set by server)

## Data Flow

1. **User stars a repo on GitHub**:
   - Frontend syncs and creates `github_user -> starred -> repo` with source='github'

2. **Server analyzes a repo's stargazers**:
   - Creates github_user records for each stargazer
   - Creates `github_user -> starred -> repo` with source='stargazer_analysis'

3. **Displaying data**:
   - Query starred relationships for the user's github_user
   - Can filter by source if needed

## Clean Architecture
- ✅ RecordIds used throughout (no string manipulation)
- ✅ Proper separation between platform users and GitHub users
- ✅ Clear relationship patterns
- ✅ Source tracking for data provenance
